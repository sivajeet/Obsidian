This study explores the potential of human-AI partnerships in code migration using Large Language Models (LLMs). The authors conducted semi-structured interviews with 11 participants using Amazon Q Code Transformation, an LLM-based tool, to investigate the human role in code migration processes (Omidvar-Tehrani & Anubhai, 2024). The research identifies two key human roles: director and reviewer. It also proposes a trust framework based on model outcomes to build confidence in LLM capabilities. The paper emphasizes the importance of carefully designed human-AI collaborations to enhance developer productivity and accelerate code migrations. While human-AI partnerships have been studied in various contexts, their application to code migration remains largely unexplored. The authors present guidelines for creating effective human-AI partnerships that augment human capabilities in software development, particularly in the context of generative AI (Omidvar-Tehrani & Anubhai, 2024).
