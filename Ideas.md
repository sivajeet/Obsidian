## Comparative Analysis of Large Language Models for Automated Code Refactoring

Code refactoring involves restructuring existing source code to enhance its internal structure while preserving its external behavior.[1] As software systems evolve, they can become increasingly complex over time. This complexity can lead to technical debt, which in turn affects development efficiency and increases the risk of defects. The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into software engineering workflows has triggered a revolution in automating coding tasks, including code refactoring.[2] However, the selection of the most suitable LLM for refactoring tasks presents significant challenges due to varying capabilities, accuracy, and performance among different models. This thesis is designed to conduct a comparative analysis of several leading LLMs—like GPT-4, Codex, and LLaMA—in the context of automated code refactoring.
